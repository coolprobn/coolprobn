Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Prabin Poudel, Frelancing Rails and Web App Developer from Nepal ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ

I have been working as a freelancer ever since I started coding in 2017, and have helped over 6 companies from all around the world; to automate their business and turn their app ideas to reality.

I occasionally contribute to Open Source Projects, mainly on projects related to Ruby and Rails.

I love working on side projects in my leisure, check out the [Ruby/Rails Bot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruby_rails_bot), I built using Ruby to help the Ruby/Rails community by retweeting all the ruby and rails hashtags. Here is the [code](https://github.com/coolprobn/ruby-twitter-bot) if you are interested in building one yourself.

I write about my struggles and solutions as a developer in my blogs frequently on my own [Personal Site](https://prabinpoudel.com.np/).

Most recently (2024), I was also working as the CEO of [Truemark Technology](https://truemark.dev/)

On the sides, I am right now building a Developer Experience tool for Rails ecosystem called [Zero Config Rails](https://zeroconfigrails.com/). It helps in automating initial boring setups when starting new Rails app by setting up all the gems you require in your applications with one line command `zen g new_app` instead of `rails new new_app` after you have configured gems required for your application from the web UI.
